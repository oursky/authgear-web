faq:
  - q: "What does a 401 Unauthorized error mean?"
    a: "A 401 Unauthorized error means the server could not authenticate the request. Either no credentials were provided, or the credentials supplied (a JWT, API key, session cookie, or Basic Auth header) were invalid, expired, or malformed. The name is a misnomer — 'Unauthorized' really means 'Unauthenticated'. Try supplying or refreshing your credentials and resend the request."
  - q: "What is the difference between 401 and 403?"
    a: "A 401 means the request has no valid identity attached — the server does not know who you are. A 403 means the server knows who you are but will not allow the action regardless. With a 401, sending valid credentials may succeed. With a 403, better credentials will not help; you need different permissions."
  - q: "How do I fix a 401 Unauthorized error?"
    a: "The fix depends on the auth method. For JWT: check whether the token is expired by decoding it and comparing the exp claim to the current time, then use a refresh token to get a new one. For API keys: verify the key is correct and has not been regenerated. For Basic Auth: re-check the username and password, and that they are correctly base64-encoded. In all cases, check the WWW-Authenticate response header — it tells you exactly which check failed."
  - q: "Why does my JWT cause a 401 Unauthorized?"
    a: "The most common reasons a JWT triggers a 401 are: the token has expired (check the exp claim), the token was signed with a different key than the one the server is using to verify (common after key rotation), the aud claim does not match the resource server's expected audience, or the server and client clocks are skewed so the token's iat or exp look invalid. Decode your token at the Authgear JWT Debugger to inspect all claims."
  - q: "What is the WWW-Authenticate header?"
    a: "The WWW-Authenticate header is sent by the server in every 401 response to tell the client how to authenticate. For OAuth 2.0 Bearer tokens it includes the realm, and optionally an error code (invalid_token, invalid_request, or insufficient_scope) and an error_description. Clients can parse this header to decide whether to show a login prompt, silently refresh a token, or display an error."
  - q: "Is a 401 Unauthorized a client or server error?"
    a: "401 is a 4xx status code, which means it is classified as a client error — the client sent a request without valid authentication. However, the root cause is often on the server side: an expired signing key, a misconfigured resource server, or a bug in token issuance. Treat it as a shared concern: the client needs to send correct credentials, but the server configuration must be correct for those credentials to be accepted."
  - q: "Should my API return 401 for a missing token or 403?"
    a: "Return 401 when no credentials are present or when the credentials are invalid, expired, or cannot be verified. Return 403 only when the request is authenticated (you know who the caller is) but that caller is not allowed to perform the action. A missing Authorization header should always be 401, not 403."
  - q: "How do OAuth refresh tokens fix 401 errors?"
    a: "When an access token expires the resource server returns a 401 with error=invalid_token in the WWW-Authenticate header. The client can catch that response, call the OAuth token endpoint with the refresh token to obtain a new access token, and replay the original request transparently. This keeps users logged in without requiring a full re-authentication, as long as the refresh token itself is still valid."
  - q: "What causes a 401 from clock skew?"
    a: "JWT verification compares the token's exp (expiry) and iat (issued at) timestamps to the current time on the server. If the client clock or the auth server clock is ahead of or behind the resource server's clock by more than a few seconds, a freshly issued token may appear expired or not yet valid. The fix is to add a leeway (tolerance) of 5–30 seconds to your JWT verification library, and to synchronise clocks via NTP."
  - q: "Can a 401 error be caused by a CDN or reverse proxy?"
    a: "Yes. If a CDN or reverse proxy is misconfigured to strip the Authorization header before forwarding the request to the origin, the origin never sees the credentials and returns 401. Some proxies also cache 401 responses, causing repeated failures even after the client sends valid credentials. Always verify that your proxy passes Authorization headers through and does not cache 4xx responses."

An **HTTP 401 Unauthorized** error means the request reached the server but was rejected because it lacked valid authentication credentials. The server knows what it needs; the client has not provided it — or has provided something invalid or expired.

> **tl;dr** — A 401 Unauthorized means the server requires authentication and either none was provided or it was invalid (expired token, wrong API key, malformed Bearer header). Unlike 403 (which means "you are authenticated but not allowed"), 401 means "log in and try again." The server must also send a `WWW-Authenticate` header telling the client exactly how to authenticate.

For developers building or consuming APIs, 401 is the most authentication-specific HTTP status code. It sits at the centre of every OAuth 2.0 flow, JWT verification pipeline, and API key scheme. Getting it right — both when you receive it and when you send it — is fundamental to building secure, well-behaved applications.

> 💡 **Debugging a rejected token right now?** Paste it into the free [JWT & JWE Debugger](/tools/jwt-jwe-debugger) to decode the header and payload in your browser — an expired `exp`, a wrong `aud`, or an unknown `kid` shows up immediately.

## What Is HTTP 401 Unauthorized?

The 401 status code is defined in [RFC 9110](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#status.401):

<blockquote><p>"The 401 (Unauthorized) status code indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource. The server generating a 401 response MUST send a WWW-Authenticate header field containing at least one challenge applicable to the target resource."</p></blockquote>

Two things stand out in that definition.

First, the word "Unauthorized" is a misnomer. The HTTP specification uses "Unauthorized" to mean **unauthenticated**: the server does not know who you are. Authorization (whether an authenticated user may perform an action) is handled by 403. This naming confusion is baked into the standard and is a frequent source of bugs in API design.

Second, a 401 **must** be accompanied by a `WWW-Authenticate` header. This header is not optional. It tells the client which authentication scheme to use — Bearer, Basic, Digest, or another scheme — and may carry additional information about exactly what went wrong. Many articles and some libraries ignore this header; they should not.

## 401 vs 403: The Critical Difference

The most common mistake in API design is returning the wrong code when authentication fails. Here is the clearest way to think about the distinction:

<div class="ag-table-wrap"><table class="ag-table">
<thead>
<tr><th>Status</th><th>Means</th><th>Will sending credentials help?</th><th>What the server expects you to do</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>401 Unauthorized</strong></td>
<td>No valid identity — the server does not know who you are</td>
<td>Yes — authenticate and retry</td>
<td>Include a valid <code>Authorization</code> header (Bearer token, API key, Basic Auth)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>403 Forbidden</strong></td>
<td>Identity is known, but access is denied for this resource</td>
<td>No — different credentials will not help</td>
<td>Request elevated permissions, or accept that the resource is off-limits</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>

RFC 9110 is explicit on this point: a 401 is appropriate when the request "lacks valid authentication credentials." A 403 is appropriate when "the server understood the request but refuses to fulfil it" regardless of authentication state. For a deeper look at the conceptual split, see [Authentication vs Authorization](/post/authentication-vs-authorization), and for a full decision guide on which code your API should return, see [HTTP 401 vs 403](/post/http-401-vs-403).

The most common bug: an API returns 403 when the `Authorization` header is entirely missing. This misleads clients into thinking they are authenticated but forbidden, rather than unauthenticated. A missing `Authorization` header is always a 401.

## The WWW-Authenticate Header (RFC 7235)

Most articles skip this header. They should not — it is the mechanism by which the server communicates *precisely* what authentication the client needs to provide or what went wrong.

For OAuth 2.0 Bearer tokens, a well-formed 401 response looks like this:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="api.example.com", error="invalid_token", error_description="The access token expired"
```

The parts:

- **`realm`** — identifies the protection space. Usually your API domain. Clients use this to cache credentials per-realm.
- **`error`** — a machine-readable code. RFC 6750 §3.1 defines three valid values for Bearer tokens:
  - `invalid_request` — the request is malformed (missing `Authorization` header, wrong format). Return **401**.
  - `invalid_token` — the token is expired, revoked, or invalid. Return **401**.
  - `insufficient_scope` — the token is valid but lacks the scope required for this resource. Return **403**, not 401.
- **`error_description`** — a human-readable message for debugging.
- **`scope`** — included when `error=insufficient_scope`. Lists the scopes required to access the resource, so the client can request a new token with the correct scopes.

The `insufficient_scope` case is important: if a valid, authenticated user's token simply does not have the right scope for an endpoint, you should return 403, not 401. Returning 401 here would incorrectly tell the client "get new credentials" when what it actually needs is a token with broader scopes.

For Basic Auth, the header is simpler:

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="My API"
```

## Common Causes of HTTP 401 Unauthorized

### 1. Missing Authorization header

The request was sent with no credentials at all. This is the baseline case — always return 401, never 403.

### 2. Expired JWT or access token

The token's `exp` claim is in the past. The server has verified the signature but the token is no longer valid. The fix is a token refresh (see below).

### 3. Malformed Bearer header

Header formatting mistakes are a common source of silent 401s. The correct format is:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

Common mistakes: `Bearer: eyJ...` (wrong format — the header name is `Authorization`, not `Bearer`), a trailing space after "Bearer", or omitting the space entirely. The `Authorization` header name and the `Bearer` scheme token are both case-insensitive per RFC 7230 and RFC 7235, but treat them as case-sensitive in practice: some older or non-compliant servers and middleware do enforce exact casing.

### 4. Wrong credentials for Basic Auth

The `Authorization: Basic <base64>` value encodes `username:password`. Mistakes include: wrong password, wrong encoding (not base64), or including a newline in the encoded value.

### 5. API key invalidated or regenerated

The key was valid at one time but has since been rotated, revoked, or changed in the provider's dashboard. The client is still using the old key.

### 6. Token revoked server-side

With refresh token rotation, when a new access token is issued the previous one may be invalidated. If a client replays a cached access token that has been revoked, the server returns 401 even though the token's `exp` has not yet passed.

### 7. Clock skew between client and auth server

JWT verification compares the `exp` and `iat` claims to the current time. If the server's clock and the client's clock (or the auth server's clock) differ by more than a few seconds, a freshly issued token may appear to be expired or not yet valid. This is particularly subtle in containerised environments where system clocks drift.

### 8. Wrong `aud` claim

The token's `aud` (audience) claim must match what the resource server expects. (For a full list of JWT attack vectors beyond 401s, see [JWT Security Best Practices](/post/jwt-security-best-practices-common-vulnerabilities).) If the access token was issued for `api.service-a.com` but the request hits `api.service-b.com`, the resource server must reject it — otherwise tokens are portable across services in ways the auth server did not intend.

### 9. Signing key mismatch after rotation

Auth servers periodically rotate their signing keys. If the resource server caches the old JWK set and the auth server has rotated to a new key pair, tokens signed with the new private key will fail signature verification, producing a 401. The resource server should re-fetch the JWKS endpoint when it encounters an unknown `kid` claim in the token header.

## How to Diagnose a 401 Unauthorized

Work through these steps in order.

### Step 1: Read the WWW-Authenticate header

The response header tells you exactly which check failed:

```bash
curl -v https://api.example.com/endpoint \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token-here" 2>&1 | grep -i "www-authenticate"
```

An `error=invalid_token` points to expiry or revocation. An `error=invalid_request` points to a malformed header.

### Step 2: Decode the JWT

Inspect the token's claims — especially `exp`, `aud`, `iss`, and `kid`:

```bash
# Print the JWT payload (no verification — for debugging only)
echo "your.jwt.token" | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -d 2>/dev/null | python3 -m json.tool
```

Or use the [Authgear JWT Debugger](/tools/jwt-jwe-debugger) to decode and inspect claims in a browser.

Check the `exp` claim against the current Unix time:

```bash
date +%s   # current Unix timestamp
# Compare to the exp value in the JWT payload
```

### Step 3: Reproduce with curl -v

```bash
curl -v https://api.example.com/protected/resource \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token-here"
```

The `-v` flag shows the full request headers you are sending and the full response headers you receive. This surfaces header-formatting mistakes and confirms which layer (CDN, proxy, or origin) is returning the 401.

### Step 4: Check auth server logs

If you control the auth server — whether Authgear, Auth0, Okta, or your own — check its logs. Auth servers log the specific rejection reason: expired token, unknown key ID, audience mismatch, or revoked token. The resource server's 401 response often gives less detail than the auth server's own logs.

## How to Fix HTTP 401 Unauthorized

### Fix: Expired JWT — Use a Refresh Token

For background on how JWTs are structured, signed, and verified, see [JWT Authentication](/post/jwt-authentication-a-secure-scalable-solution-for-modern-applications).

First, detect expiry before making the request:

```javascript
function isTokenExpired(token) {
  try {
    const payload = JSON.parse(atob(token.split('.')[1]));
    // Check exp with a 30-second buffer to pre-empt imminent expiry
    return payload.exp < (Date.now() / 1000) + 30;
  } catch {
    return true;
  }
}
```

Then refresh proactively, or catch the 401 and refresh reactively:

```javascript
async function refreshAccessToken(refreshToken) {
  const response = await fetch('https://accounts.example.com/oauth/token', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
      grant_type: 'refresh_token',
      refresh_token: refreshToken,
      client_id: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
    }),
  });
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Refresh failed — user must re-authenticate');
  }
  const { access_token, refresh_token } = await response.json();
  return { access_token, refresh_token };
}
```

Note: only `invalid_token` errors are fixable by refreshing. If the `WWW-Authenticate` header says `error=invalid_request` (malformed header) or the refresh token itself is revoked, a full re-authentication is required.

### Fix: Missing or Malformed Bearer Header

The correct format is a single space between "Bearer" and the token. The header name and scheme token are case-insensitive per the HTTP spec, but use the canonical casing shown below for maximum compatibility:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyXzEyMyIsImV4cCI6MTc0NjUwMDAwMH0.signature
```

In code:

```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/resource', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});
```

A common mistake in fetch is concatenating strings without the space: `` `Bearer${token}` `` instead of `` `Bearer ${token}` ``.

### Fix: API Key Issues

API key 401s are almost always one of three things: the wrong key was copied, the key was regenerated in the dashboard and the old one invalidated, or the key is being sent in the wrong header or query parameter.

Check which header or param the API expects. Common patterns:

```http
# Header-based (most common)
Authorization: Api-Key YOUR_KEY_HERE
X-API-Key: YOUR_KEY_HERE

# Query parameter (less secure, avoid for sensitive APIs)
GET /resource?api_key=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

Verify the key against your configuration by printing the first and last 4 characters — a truncated match rules out copy-paste errors without exposing the full key.

### Fix: Basic Auth — Wrong Credentials

Basic Auth encodes `username:password` as base64. Construct and verify the value:

```bash
# Encode credentials
echo -n "myuser:mypassword" | base64
# Output: bXl1c2VyOm15cGFzc3dvcmQ=

# Test with curl
curl -v https://api.example.com/resource \
  -H "Authorization: Basic bXl1c2VyOm15cGFzc3dvcmQ="
```

Watch out for special characters in passwords: `@`, `:`, `+`, and `/` must be percent-encoded when constructing the URL form, but in the `Authorization` header you base64-encode the raw `user:pass` string (no percent-encoding needed).

### Fix: Clock Skew

Add a leeway to your JWT verification. Most JWT libraries support this directly:

```javascript
// jsonwebtoken (Node.js)
jwt.verify(token, publicKey, {
  clockTolerance: 30, // 30-second leeway
});
```

```python
# PyJWT
import jwt
payload = jwt.decode(
    token,
    public_key,
    algorithms=['RS256'],
    leeway=30,  # seconds
)
```

The typical safe value is 5–30 seconds. Beyond 60 seconds you start accepting tokens that should be considered expired.

Also ensure all servers in your infrastructure synchronise time via NTP. On Linux:

```bash
timedatectl status | grep "NTP synchronized"
```

### Fix: Wrong JWKS or Signing Key

When your resource server verifies JWTs from an OIDC provider, it fetches the provider's public keys from the JWKS endpoint. If the provider rotates keys, cached keys become stale.

The correct pattern is to re-fetch JWKS when verification fails with an unknown key ID (`kid`):

```javascript
import jwksClient from 'jwks-rsa';

const client = jwksClient({
  jwksUri: 'https://accounts.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json',
  cache: true,
  cacheMaxAge: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10-minute cache
  rateLimit: true,
});

async function getPublicKey(header) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    client.getSigningKey(header.kid, (err, key) => {
      if (err) reject(err);
      else resolve(key.getPublicKey());
    });
  });
}
```

Libraries like `jwks-rsa` handle cache invalidation and re-fetching automatically. Avoid hardcoding public keys — they will break on the next rotation. See [What Is JWKS?](/post/what-is-jwks) for a deeper explanation of key sets and rotation.

## When to Return 401 vs 403 (for API Designers)

If you are building an API, use this decision rule:

- **No credentials at all** → 401
- **Credentials present but invalid, expired, or unverifiable** → 401
- **Credentials valid, identity confirmed, but not allowed to do this** → 403

RFC 6750 §3.1 maps Bearer token error codes to status codes:

<div class="ag-table-wrap"><table class="ag-table">
<thead>
<tr><th>WWW-Authenticate error value</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Correct status code</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>invalid_request</code></td>
<td>Request is malformed — missing or duplicate parameter, bad format</td>
<td>401</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>invalid_token</code></td>
<td>Token is expired, revoked, malformed, or does not exist</td>
<td>401</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>insufficient_scope</code></td>
<td>Token is valid but lacks the required scope for this resource</td>
<td>403</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>

The `insufficient_scope` case is the one most often implemented wrongly. A valid token that lacks the `write:reports` scope should get a 403 — the client is authenticated, it simply does not have permission. Returning a 401 here incorrectly tells the client to re-authenticate, when re-authenticating with the same client credentials will produce the same under-scoped token.

## 401 and OAuth: The Refresh-Token Pattern

The most robust way to handle 401s in a client application is an HTTP interceptor that automatically refreshes the access token and replays the original request. Here is a production-quality implementation using the Fetch API:

```javascript
class AuthenticatedClient {
  constructor({ tokenEndpoint, clientId, getTokens, saveTokens, onLogout }) {
    this.tokenEndpoint = tokenEndpoint;
    this.clientId = clientId;
    this.getTokens = getTokens;   // () => { accessToken, refreshToken }
    this.saveTokens = saveTokens; // ({ accessToken, refreshToken }) => void
    this.onLogout = onLogout;     // () => void — called when refresh fails
    this._refreshPromise = null;  // deduplicate concurrent refresh calls
  }

  async fetch(url, options = {}) {
    const { accessToken } = this.getTokens();
    const response = await this._doFetch(url, options, accessToken);

    if (response.status !== 401) return response;

    // Check whether the 401 is fixable by refreshing.
    // Fall back to attempting a refresh when WWW-Authenticate is absent —
    // many APIs omit this header. If your token endpoint also returns 401
    // (e.g. on a revoked refresh token), the catch below handles it.
    const wwwAuth = response.headers.get('WWW-Authenticate') || '';
    const isTokenError = wwwAuth.includes('invalid_token') || wwwAuth === '';

    if (!isTokenError) return response; // invalid_request — not fixable by refresh

    // Deduplicate: if another call is already refreshing, await the same promise
    if (!this._refreshPromise) {
      this._refreshPromise = this._refresh().finally(() => {
        this._refreshPromise = null;
      });
    }

    try {
      await this._refreshPromise;
    } catch {
      this.onLogout();
      return response;
    }

    // Replay the original request with the new access token
    const { accessToken: newToken } = this.getTokens();
    return this._doFetch(url, options, newToken);
  }

  async _doFetch(url, options, token) {
    return fetch(url, {
      ...options,
      headers: {
        ...options.headers,
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      },
    });
  }

  async _refresh() {
    const { refreshToken } = this.getTokens();
    const res = await fetch(this.tokenEndpoint, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
      body: new URLSearchParams({
        grant_type: 'refresh_token',
        refresh_token: refreshToken,
        client_id: this.clientId,
      }),
    });
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Refresh token rejected');
    const tokens = await res.json();
    this.saveTokens(tokens);
  }
}
```

Key points:

- The interceptor reads `WWW-Authenticate` to distinguish refreshable errors (`invalid_token`) from non-refreshable ones (`invalid_request` — malformed header). Refreshing blindly on every 401 causes infinite loops.
- A `_refreshPromise` deduplication pattern prevents a burst of concurrent 401 responses from triggering multiple simultaneous refresh calls (which would invalidate each other under refresh-token rotation).
- If the refresh itself fails — because the refresh token is expired or revoked — `onLogout` is called, forcing a full re-authentication.

## Prevention Best Practices

**Set short access token expiry.** A common default is 15–30 minutes for access tokens (Authgear's default is 30 minutes). A short expiry limits the blast radius if a token is leaked — an attacker has at most ~30 minutes before the token is useless. Refresh tokens are typically longer-lived (30–90 days, depending on your security requirements) and single-use under rotation.

**Use refresh token rotation.** Each refresh token use issues a new refresh token and invalidates the old one. If a stolen refresh token is used, the next legitimate use by the real client will fail (the legitimate client's token has been invalidated), which surfaces the compromise.

**Monitor your 401 rate.** A sudden spike in 401 responses is an early indicator of auth issues: a key rotation that was not propagated to all services, a deployment that shipped with wrong environment variables, or a credential-stuffing attack. Wire your 401 rate into your alerting dashboard.

**Always send WWW-Authenticate in 401 responses.** This is required by RFC 9110 and RFC 6750, but many APIs omit it. Without it, clients cannot distinguish between a missing token, an expired token, or a malformed header — they can only retry blindly.

**Validate the aud claim.** Resource servers must reject tokens whose `aud` does not match. Without this check, a token issued for Service A works on Service B — token portability is a security risk.

**Use a managed auth platform.** Implementing all of the above correctly — JWKS rotation, refresh-token rotation, WWW-Authenticate headers, clock-skew leeway — is non-trivial. A managed platform handles these by default.

## 401 with Authgear: Out-of-the-Box Handling

[Authgear](https://www.authgear.com) handles the authentication infrastructure that sits behind every 401 decision:

- **Token issuance and expiry**: Authgear issues short-lived access tokens (default 30 minutes, configurable) with correct `exp`, `aud`, `iss`, and `kid` claims. Expiry is enforced server-side.
- **Refresh token rotation**: Enabled by default. Each refresh issues a new refresh token and immediately invalidates the previous one. Stolen refresh tokens are detected and surfaced as auth events.
- **JWKS endpoint**: Authgear exposes a standards-compliant JWKS endpoint at `/.well-known/jwks.json`. Keys are rotated periodically. Resource servers that fetch JWKS correctly will never see a signing-key mismatch 401. See [What Is JWKS?](/post/what-is-jwks) for details.
- **WWW-Authenticate headers**: Authgear's OAuth token endpoint and resource server integrations return properly formed `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` headers with RFC 6750-compliant error codes.
- **Clock skew tolerance**: Authgear applies a configurable leeway on token verification to handle minor clock drift in distributed deployments.

If your 401 errors come from mismatched configuration between Authgear and your resource server — wrong `aud`, wrong JWKS URL, or missing `Authorization` forwarding in your proxy — the [Authgear documentation](/docs/get-started/start-building) walks through correct resource server integration patterns for common frameworks.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What does a 401 Unauthorized error mean?

A 401 Unauthorized error means the server could not authenticate the request. Either no credentials were provided, or the credentials supplied — a JWT, API key, session cookie, or Basic Auth header — were invalid, expired, or malformed. The name is a misnomer: "Unauthorized" really means "Unauthenticated." Try supplying or refreshing your credentials and resending the request.

### What is the difference between 401 and 403?

A 401 means the request has no valid identity attached — the server does not know who you are. A 403 means the server knows who you are but will not allow the action. With a 401, sending valid credentials may succeed. With a 403, better credentials will not help; you need different permissions or a token with a wider scope.

### How do I fix a 401 Unauthorized error?

The fix depends on the auth method. For JWT: decode the token, check the `exp` claim, and use a refresh token if it has expired. For API keys: verify the key has not been regenerated. For Basic Auth: recheck the username and password and confirm the base64 encoding is correct. In all cases, check the `WWW-Authenticate` header — it contains the specific error code.

### Why does my JWT cause a 401?

The most common JWT-related causes are: expired `exp` claim, wrong signing key (after key rotation), `aud` mismatch between the token and the resource server, and clock skew making the token appear expired. Use the [Authgear JWT Debugger](/tools/jwt-jwe-debugger) to inspect all claims.

### What is the WWW-Authenticate header?

The `WWW-Authenticate` header is sent in every 401 response to tell the client how to authenticate. For OAuth 2.0 Bearer tokens it carries an error code (`invalid_token`, `invalid_request`, or `insufficient_scope`) and a human-readable description. Clients should parse this header to decide whether to refresh silently, prompt for login, or display an error.

### Is a 401 Unauthorized a client or server error?

It is classified as a 4xx client error — the client sent a request without valid authentication. However, the root cause is often on the server side: an expired signing key, a misconfigured resource server, or a proxy stripping the `Authorization` header. Treat it as a shared concern.

### Should my API return 401 for a missing token or 403?

Return 401. A missing `Authorization` header means there is no authentication present at all — the server does not know who the caller is. 403 should only be used when the caller is authenticated but is not permitted to perform the action.

### How do OAuth refresh tokens fix 401 errors?

When an access token expires, the resource server returns a 401 with `error=invalid_token`. The client catches that response, calls the OAuth token endpoint with the refresh token to obtain a new access token, and replays the original request. Users stay logged in without a full re-authentication — as long as the refresh token itself is still valid and has not been rotated away.

### What causes a 401 from clock skew?

JWT verification compares the token's `exp` and `iat` timestamps to the current server time. If any clock in the chain — client, auth server, or resource server — has drifted, a freshly issued token may appear expired or not yet valid. Add a leeway of 5–30 seconds to your JWT verification library and synchronise all servers via NTP.

### Can a CDN or reverse proxy cause a 401?

Yes. A proxy that strips the `Authorization` header before forwarding the request to the origin means the origin never sees the credentials and returns 401. Some proxies also cache 401 responses, causing repeated failures even after the client sends valid credentials. Confirm your proxy passes `Authorization` through and does not cache 4xx responses. For related proxy errors, see [HTTP 502 Bad Gateway](/post/http-502-bad-gateway).

## Summary

A 401 Unauthorized means the server could not verify who is making the request. The most common causes are expired JWTs, missing or malformed `Authorization` headers, revoked API keys, and signing key mismatches after rotation. The `WWW-Authenticate` response header — which servers must include in every 401 — tells you exactly which check failed, and should be the first thing you read when debugging.

For API designers: use 401 when there is no valid identity, and 403 when there is a valid identity but it is not permitted to act. For a related error that often appears in auth-protected systems, see [HTTP 403 Forbidden](/post/http-403-forbidden).
